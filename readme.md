# Present Quest

Created for the [HolidayJS 2013](http://holidayjs.com/) hackathon.

This is a holiday themes PuzzleQuest clone with a classy holiday theme.

Built as a real-time, 2 player game using Backbone on the frontend and Firebase to have data and real-time goodness.

At the time of presentaton, the app only drew the board and saved piece data to Firebase.

## Installation

Clone this repo, the `npm install` and `bower install`

To run the app, simply run `node index`. It'll report what port it's listening on, so open localhost on that port in your browser.
